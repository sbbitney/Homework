Based on the data, several trends emerge.  Men are easily the highest percentage of users more interesting, and perhaps more useful is that users who identify as “other/Non-Disclosed”, while being a small group of only 11 players, had both the highest average purchase price and the highest average purchase total per person.  It may be worthwhile for the company to increase its efforts to attract more players who identify as other or prefer not to disclose their gender as this appears to be a profitable, albeit small, group of players.  Perhaps creating more playable characters who are non gender binary could help in these efforts.

Another trend from the data is that the total purchase value was less than $13 for the vast majority of players.  Presupposing the data represents the lifetime spend of each player, the company should be very strategic about its customer acquisition cost as any single customer acquisition costing more than $13 will be unlikely to represent a profit for the company.  Furthermore, more resources should be put to increasing players’ total number of purchases, as the highest spending players bought, on average, less than 4 items per person.  	

Finally, it is clear that players age 20-24 represent not only the largest group of Heroes of Pymoli players but also one of the highest groups in terms of average purchase total per person.   This age group represented the largest total purchase value of any group by far, spending nearly 3 times more than the next highest spending group.  Efforts toward retaining this group of players as well as analyzing why they are so willing to spend, will help the company to continue to earn revenue from this and other segments of its player community.
